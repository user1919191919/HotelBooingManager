## Project Title
**Hotel Booking Manager**

## Student Name: Beksultan Akmatbek uulu.
## Group: COMCEH-24

## Project Description
The **Hotel Booking Manager** is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage hotel room bookings and user accounts. It provides a user-friendly interface for guests to book rooms, administrators to manage room details, and supports user authentication. The application connects to a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data about users, rooms, and bookings.

## Objectives
The primary goals of the Hotel Booking Manager are:
- To provide a seamless platform for users to create accounts and log in securely.
- To allow guests to view available rooms, select rooms, and book them for specific dates.
- To enable administrators to manage room details (add, update, delete) and view booking information.
- To ensure data persistence using a PostgreSQL database.
- To validate user inputs and ensure robust error handling for a smooth user experience.

## Project Requirement List
The following are the key requirements implemented in the project:
1. **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts (`CreateHotel.java`) and log in (`LoginHotel.java`) with a username and password (minimum 5 characters).
2. **Admin Access**: Admin users (username: "admin", password: "admin") can access the admin panel (`HotelManagerAdmin.java`) to manage rooms.
3. **Room Management**: Admins can add, update, and delete room details, including room number, type, capacity, price, availability, and floor (`HotelManagerAdmin.java`).
4. **Booking System**: Guests can book rooms by providing their name, phone number, room details, check-in/out dates, and calculating total days and price (`BookingHotel.java`).
5. **Booking Management**: Admins can view, update, and delete bookings (`BookingHotelAdmin.java`).
6. **Database Integration**: The application connects to a PostgreSQL database (`beksultanfinal`) to store user, room, and booking data.
7. **Input Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled, room numbers are valid (100–400), and check-out dates are after check-in dates.
8. **Room Availability Check**: Prevents booking of already booked rooms by checking the "Availability" field in the database.
9. **Total Price Calculation**: Automatically calculates the total price based on the number of days and room price.
10. **User Interface**: Provides a graphical interface using Swing for easy navigation, with clear labels and buttons for all actions.

## Documentation

### Algorithms and Data Structures
- **Database Interaction**: The application uses JDBC to connect to a PostgreSQL database. SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are executed using `PreparedStatement` to ensure security and efficiency.
- **Data Structures**: 
  - **JTable**: Used to display room and booking data in a tabular format (`RoomsTable` in `HotelManagerAdmin.java` and `BookingHotelAdmin.java`).
  - **DefaultTableModel**: Manages table data dynamically, allowing rows to be populated from database results.
- **Input Validation**: Checks for empty fields, valid room numbers, and logical date ranges (e.g., check-out after check-in).
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks handle SQL exceptions and display user-friendly error messages via `JOptionPane`.

### Functions/Modules
- **LoginHotel.java**: Handles user login with database validation and admin access.
- **CreateHotel.java**: Allows new user registration with username/password validation.
- **HotelManagerAdmin.java**: Admin interface for managing room details (CRUD operations).
- **BookingHotel.java**: Guest interface for booking rooms, calculating days and price.
- **BookingHotelAdmin.java**: Admin interface for managing bookings.
- **WelcomeHotel.java**: Entry point with options to log in or register.
- **Database Connection**: The `Connect()` method in multiple classes establishes a connection to the PostgreSQL database using JDBC.

### Challenges Faced
- **Date Handling**: Ensuring correct date parsing and validation for check-in/check-out dates required careful use of `java.sql.Date` and `JDateChooser`.
- **Room Availability**: Implementing checks to prevent double-booking required querying the database for the room's "Availability" status.
- **UI Layout**: Managing multiple Swing components (panels, tables, buttons) to create a clean and functional interface was complex.
- **Database Errors**: Handling SQL exceptions gracefully to avoid application crashes and provide meaningful feedback to users.

## Test Cases and Outputs
